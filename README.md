# Raspberry Pi LED Matrix Applets
Some small applets that are designed to run on a 64x64 LED matrix with a Raspberry Pi.

## TODO:
- [X] NOT HAPPENING - Make something that automatically chmods the resources folder for each individual applet
- [X] Some kind of Config class for an applet e.g. for the tarkov applet, I want to be able to specify what items to get the values for.
- [ ] Applet.stop() needs some more sort of memory management - destruction
- [ ] Improve README
- [ ] Add an Applet template
- [X] Scale between red and green for system usage
- [ ] Tarkov applet - format price function to include millions

## Applet Ideas:
- [X] Internet speed test
